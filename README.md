# Todo List Application with Go and Fiber

This is a simple Todo List CRUD API built using [Go](https://golang.org/) and the [Fiber](https://gofiber.io/) web framework. The application stores data in-memory, meaning all data will be lost once the server is stopped. This project serves as an introduction to building RESTful APIs with Go.

## Features

- **Create** a new todo item
- **Read** all todo items or a specific item by ID
- **Update** a todo item by ID
